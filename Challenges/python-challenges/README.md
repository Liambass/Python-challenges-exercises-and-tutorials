# python-challenges
This repo contains a collection of practice problems involving python fundamentals such as string manipulation, iteration, collections and conditionals. The format of these challenges is similar to the format of the python assessments and should help you to prepare for these. This branch has a challenges file (in programs) with empty function definitions for you to fill in with your solutions to the problems.  

The tests folder contains a test file which will check your solutions against some test cases; once you think you have solved one of the problems you can run the tests to validate your solutions:  
* First ensure that pytest is installed on your system (if it is not, run the following command: pip3 install pytest)
* Make sure that you have saved the challenges.py file with your solutions in
* Run the tests with the following command: python3 -m pytest
