# Create a python file.

# Set three variables to the words "Good", "Day" and your name.

# word1 = "Good"
# word2 = "Day"
# word3 = "John"
# Then "add" them together or concatenate them with a space inbetween each word.

# sentence = word1 + " " + word2 + " " + word3
# Now print out the variable.

# print(sentence)

word3 = "John"
sentence = word1 + " " + word2 + " " + word3
sentence2 = f"{word1} {word2} {word3}" 
print(sentence)
